# Park-Save
Monitoring the availability of parking slots.
This app needs to publish before using it.
When we start the app we have to signup and then create an account. Now it will take you to the map where you can put the location and it is app is also integrated with google maps which will give updates itself and moreover it is not just for finding slots but even with this app user will get free parking slot after every 9th use of the app. 
It can also help government as they can get visualisation of the data and check which place is being used the most and which is not being used at all even on the weekdays and weekends.
Users get loyalty points, email alert features and even an email notification will be given for parking fares of the place used by the user.
It is one packed solution for hassle-free parking.
